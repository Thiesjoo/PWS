# PWS of Thies | Boids

_Originial implementation by: [Ben eater](https://github.com/beneater)_

This is the simulation part of my "Profielwerkstuk" (PWS) or "Profile Paper" in english.
The paper itself is not published due to piracy concerns


## Rules

- Make boids stick to roads (Some results from AVG Speed if there are more boids)
- Make boids intersect eachother (Results with how many boids and AVG speed)

- Add max turning radius (Too hard for this project)
