This is the simulation part of my "Profielwerkstuk" (PWS) or "Profile Paper" in english.
The paper itself is not published due to piracy concerns. 

The instructions part of the paper can be found in [the instructions](Instructies.md) (Dutch).
Extensions for this simulation can be found in [extensions](Uitbreidingen.md) (Also dutch)
